# German Docs, in a programmer's dialect

Welcome to **_German Docs_**, a hobby project of mine meant to document what the
German language is about in a way that's easier to digest (at least for me!)

## About this site

This site is my attempt at journaling my journey learning German in my own way, and
maybe helping someone else learn something along the way.

I don't think there's a lack of good content out there, I just think I can do
better for myself. Also, it's never a bad idea to flex some webdev skills
while I'm at it! The idea is to be as straight-forward as possible and to group
relevant content together.

Also, finding relevant content is made easier using the fuzzy search which you can
see at the top of your screen.

Contributions are more than welcome. The way for you to do that at the moment is
through a github issue. I'll be tackling that and various other improvements if
and when engagement improves and I have time.

To navigate the website, you can use the table of contents on the left. You
navigate sections within each page using the mini table on the right (only
available on wider screens)

I'd love any feedback, regarding the site or the content within it, as well as
any improvement suggestions! You can email me at [aziznal.dev@gmail.com](mailto:aziznal.dev@gmail.com)

## Why German?

There are many benefits to learning German, even more so as a developer! Here
are a few:

- Job opportunities
- Lots of countries speak it
  (or something similar to it, i.e. Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium, etc. )
- Literally expands your mind
- Sounds cool
- Did I mention job opportunities?
- More shows to watch on Netflix

## Getting started with German

German is an interperted language, which means that you can run it
without compiling it first. This is good news for complete newbies like
me!

Jokes aside, what I'm trying to say is that you will be very intimidated if you
take a look at the table of contents whilst having 0 knowledge of German, but
don't let that feeling take hold of you. You don't need to know everything at the
beginning, nor even eventually for that matter.

There's an interesting principle called the 20/80 rule. In the case of language
learning, it translates into the fact that you can get through 80% of your daily
German speaking needs with only 20%-ish of the full knowledge you can acquire.

Speaking a language is much more nuanced that knowing when to use the correct
tense, capitalizing nouns, or putting a comma in the right place.

Remember, only one thing matters: Never stop making progress.

## About Me

I'm a fullstack web developer originally from Syria. I found my way to Turkey
somehow and I've been working there for the last couple of years as a web developer.

I started my journey into programming in 2019 by first writing web scrapers in
Python, with which I was able to scrape tons of data from websites which would
rather I didn't.

Following having my bot accounts banned by every well-known social media provider
out there, I delved into Angular and found my first job a year later through a
connection in College.

After 2.5 years of Angular and a bit of React, I chose NextJS (which is what this site is built with, btw) as my starter template for new projects because of \*_chef's kiss_\* perfect it is for the kind of project I do.

At the start of 2022, I took to learning the German language in search of the
start to the next chapter of my life, preferably somewhere where I make more
than 10% of what the western or european developer makes (oh yeah, it's that bad in Turkey).

I speak Arabic natively, English as a second language, and Turkish as a 3rd language, with German being my 4th language.
