# Genders (Die Geschlechter)

Nouns in germans have genders. German has three genders in its grammar:

- Der (masculine / männlich)

- Die (feminine / weibliche)

- Das (neuter / neutrum)

The above list doesn't represent the genders, but rather how the definite articles
behave with each gender.

Noun gender is a linguistic category that may not necessarily reflect the biological
or social association of a gender as a human might perceive it. A good example of this
is the word "Das Mädchen" (the girl) which might make sense to use Die instead of
Das, but isn't because German do be like that sometimes.

Said differently, just because a noun is "feminine" or "masculine" to human norms,
doesn't mean it's going to match the gender in german, although much of the time, it does (e.g. The Woman = Die Frau).

### Examples:

- Der mann, Der Freund

- Die Frau, Die Freundin

- Das Haus, Das Zimmer

## Telling the difference

Although many methods exist out there to tell the gender of a word, they aren't
100% accurate, so realistically you'll have to memorize a lot of words and then
rely on your gut to tell you the gender of any given word. This is something
that happens after you've learned a sufficient number of words and you'll feel
more confident in your guesses as time goes on.

Even native german speakers have trouble using the correct gender sometimes, so
that should tell you something.

Regardless, there are a few methods that help with this. I recommend this video for that:
