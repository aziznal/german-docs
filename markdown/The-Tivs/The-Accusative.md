# The Accusative

The accusative in german means when you're targeting something in your verb,
not as the recipient of an action but more so as the affected entity.

Accusative causes articles to change into different forms.

Example:

- Ich esse den Apfel

- Ich trinke die Milch

- Ich verkaue das Haus
