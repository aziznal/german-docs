# German Docs, in a programmer's dialect

## Note:

This website is still a work in progress.

## About this site

This site is my attempt at journaling my journey learning German in my own way, and
maybe helping someone else learn something along the way.

Contributions are more than welcome. Unfortunately, the only way for you to do
that at the moment is through a github issue. I'll be tackling that and various
other improvements if and when engagement improves and I have time.

## Getting started with German

German is an interperted language, which means that you can run it
without compiling it first. This is good news for complete newbies like
me!

There are many benefits to learning German, even more so as a developer! Here are a few:

- Job opportunities
- Lots of countries speak it
  (or something similar to it, i.e. Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium, etc. )
- Literally expands your mind
- Sounds cool
- More shows to watch on Netflix
