# The German Alphabet

## The Standard Alphabet

The Alphabet in German is very similar to its English counterpart, with a few
exceptions to how letters are pronounced and a few extra letters.

It's highly recommended that you listen to it being pronounced to get a better
grasp. Pronouncing letters correctly is not something you should pay too much
attention to in the beginning as you will pick it up with time as you learn
more vocabulary and start having conversations.

I personally watched this video on youtube to learn the pronounciation of many
of the letters, once: [Link](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=21)

You have your usual A -> Z (pronounciation links included for each):

- [A](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=21) [B](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=24)
  [C](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=27) [D](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=30)
  [E](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=33) [F](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=36)
  [G](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=39) [H](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=42)
  [I](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=45) [J](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=48)
  [K](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=51) [L](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=54)
  [M](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=56) [N](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=57)
  [O](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=62) [P](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=65)
  [Q](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=68) [R](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=71)
  [S](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=74) [T](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=76)
  [U](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=80) [V](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=83)
  [W](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=85) [X](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=88)
  [Y](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=91) [Z](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=94)

Notable differences in letter names are:

- C: Tseh
- J: Jot
- V: Fau
- W: Veh
- Y: Ypsilon
- Z: Tset

## Special Letters

The German language has 3 special letters called _Umlaute_:

- [Ä](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=690)
- [Ö](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=713)
- [Ü](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=730)

The two-dot symbol (¨) on top of the previous letters is called an _umlaut_,
hence the name.

There is also another well-known special letter called the eszett or
_scharfes S_ (Sharp S):

- [ß](https://youtu.be/wpBPaDI5IgI?t=747)

An interesting thing to know about this letter is that there are no words that start
with it.

## A different method of writing special letters

Understandably, you may find yourself ignoring the Umlaute while starting out since
they are not easy to write on a US Qwery layout keyboard. Nevertheless, you should
be aware that changing an umlaut to a non-umlaut in a word could change its meaning
completely.

In short: don't simply convert an umlaut to a non-umlaut while writing a word
as that could change the meaning of the word entirely.

Luckily, there is a compromise.

In German, if you can't type or write special characters like ä, ö, ü, or ß,
there's a workaround. For the umlauted vowels, you can replace them with "ae,"
"oe," or "ue," known as "Umlaut Ersatz."

Similarly, the sharp S (ß) can be swapped with "ss," called "Eszett Ersatz."
